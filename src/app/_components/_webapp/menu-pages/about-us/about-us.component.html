      <div>
        Collins Tours was founded in 1960 by Carl and Judy Collins of Saint John, New Brunswick.  Fuelled by a passion for travel, sharing new experiences , Carl and Judy have hosted thousands of Maritimers, helping them to experience their travel dreams and adventures.  Each trip was carefully curated and planned by Carl and Judy.  They differentiated themselves by coordinating every last detail to ensure a worry-free experience for their customers and by providing premium group experiences.

        The company is now led by their son, Greg Collins, who spent most of his life travelling and learning from his Mom and Dad's experiences.  Greg holds a Business Degree and a Diploma in Hospitality and Tourism. He has grown the company to include over 30 annual tours, including some of the most exclusive premium offerings available from the Maritimes.  While the company remains based in the Collins' hometown of Saint John, tour pick up points are coordinated across the Maritimes.
